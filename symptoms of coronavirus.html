                <p>These
                    symptoms
                    are
                    usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms.

                    Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of
                    every 5
                    people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
                    those with
                    underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer,

                    at
                    higher risk of developing serious illness. However, anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously
                    ill.

                    pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately. If possible,
                    it
                    is
                    recommended to call the health care provider or facility first, so the patient can be directed to
